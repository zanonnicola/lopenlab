Through painting, drawing, designing, engraving and much more, children have the opportunity to grow, develop their creativity along with their ability to express themselves in English. Our workshops are designed for school-aged children from 6 onwards. They are delivered by [Tatiana](/en/team), our Fine Arts Teacher, at [Happy Place by Vacouva](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Vacouva/@47.2147032,-1.5433222,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4805eeb84753995d:0xb3771b6433584ec0!2s43+Quai+de+Malakoff,+44000+Nantes!3b1!8m2!3d47.2147032!4d-1.5411335!3m4!1s0x4805eeb8399276c5:0xe54ac076a5ce2080!8m2!3d47.2146419!4d-1.5411651) (Gare Sud neighbourhood).
