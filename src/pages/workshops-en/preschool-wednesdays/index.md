On Wednesday, children meet at our Lab for a moment of fun discovery and experimentation: fine arts, DIY, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) projects, cooking, gardening… and all through English of course! For kids, it’s also an opportunity to have a bit of a break in the middle of the week, be in an environment that is different from school and feels a little bit more like home. They get to try out and discover new disciplines while learning a lot of new things.
