Colouring, painting, cutting, creating… We believe that to learn a language you need to really live it beyond learning from books. At our Arts & Crafts workshop, children develop their creativity through discovering fine arts. They learn and improve their English in a practical and fun way. Workshops are hosted by [Tatiana](/en/team), our Fine Arts Teacher. They take place in the heart of Nantes, a few steps away from the main station.

> We also work with preschools; please [get in touch](/en/contact-us) with us directly if you want to discuss your project.
