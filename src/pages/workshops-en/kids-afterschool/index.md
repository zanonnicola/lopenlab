After a healthy snack, children can relax and have fun after a busy day at school. They have access to a wide range of activities: various games, painting and drawing, yoga and relaxation, gardening and DIY activities, to name but a few. All activities are designed to be enriching and creative, respecting the child’s rhythm and needs.

Workshops take place in our own very [Lab](https://www.google.fr/maps?q=77+rue+de+la+tullaye+nantes&rlz=1C1JZAP_enFR710FR711&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL6Pi9jd_cAhULCxoKHZXoAKEQ_AUICigB), a place entirely designed for children, in the middle of a garden. A warm environment so that kids feel at home immediately, thus helping them express themselves with ease. Workshops are carried out in small groups and with children of similar ages.   

> We can come and pick up kids from schools located in the neighbourhood of Rond-point de Paris. We are currently creating groups of children of similar ages (3 to 4 and 5 to 6); please contact us if you want to have more information on our programme, know the names of the schools we work with in the neighbourhood and enrol your child(ren) for the next school year. We look forward to hearing from you!
