We believe learning by doing makes a lot of sense. We want kids to develop their creativity and have fun, while learning and practicing English… naturally. We want to provide kids with high quality activities that can help them grow and develop. 

For you, parents, our workshops may also be an opportunity to discover our teaching methods so that you too can help your child or children in their development and in their learning and practicing of English outside of the classes. It may also be an opportunity for you to spend a special moment with your child, meet other parents and discuss with teaching professionals.

Our workshops are adapted to babies, toddlers and children aged between 1 and 11. They take place in the mornings, after school, on Wednesdays, on Saturdays and during the school holidays.

Workshops are carried out entirely in English. They are not only open to kids who already speak English but are also open to kids and parents who don’t. Our team understands both French and English and is perfectly trained to make kids feel at ease speaking a foreign language.
