We believe learning by doing makes a lot of sense. We want kids to develop their creativity and have fun, while learning and practicing English… naturally. We want to provide children with high quality content, that can help them grow and develop.

For you, parents, our workshops may also be an opportunity to discover our teaching methods so that you too can help your child or children in their development and in their learning and practicing of English outside of the classes. It may also be an opportunity for you to spend quality time with your child, to meet other parents and to engage with teaching professionals.

Our workshops are adapted to babies, toddlers and children aged between 1 and 11. They take place in the morning, after school, on Wednesdays, on Saturdays and during the school holidays in one of our two friendly and welcoming places in Nantes.

Workshops are carried out entirely in English. They are not only open to kids who already speak English but are also open to kids and parents who don’t. Our team members are both French and English speaking professionals, with a wealth of experience in making kids feel at ease in speaking a foreign language.
