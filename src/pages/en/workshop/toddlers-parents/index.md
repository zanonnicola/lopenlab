To feel and touch objects, making things, moving around and singing songs… Toddlers develop their senses through fun and physical activities carried out in English only.

Each workshop is based on a specific theme that kids get to explore via a different range of sensorial activities. Themes are directly related to children’s day-to-day activities and linked to their interests. 

We use an active learning pedagogy and various teaching materials. Workshops take place on a weekly basis, with several slots and locations being available throughout the week. Workshops are carried out by Cecilia, our linguist. Discover her profile here. For more information on our methodology, please click here.
