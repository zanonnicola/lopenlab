We have a team of native English-speaking teachers and bilingual professionals qualified in their area of expertise. 

We are all university degree level professionals and parents ourselves, with experience with babies and children. Just like L’Open Lab for Kids, the team is international and multicultural: English, Irish, American, French and Brazilian.

You will soon discover here all the members of our team.
