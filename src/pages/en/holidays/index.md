Our holiday workshops are an opportunity for children to take a break, have fun, discover and explore new things, while learning and practising English. Our activities are all focused on developing creativity, motor skills and fostering speaking skills. Our objectives are to help children develop or maintain a taste for speaking English, develop confidence in their ability to speak and understand the language, while developing new skills and... having fun!
