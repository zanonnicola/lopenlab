The next holiday workshop takes place **from Monday, 22nd to Friday, 26th October**. It is open to children from 3 onwards and takes place either in the morning (from 9am to 12pm) or in the afternoon (from 2 to 5pm). In total, that's 15 hours of activities in English for one whole week. 

Our holiday workshops are an opportunity for children to take a break, have fun, discover and explore new things, while learning and practising English. Our activities are all focused on developing creativity and fostering speaking skills. Our objectives are to help children develop or maintain a taste for speaking English, develop confidence in their ability to speak and understand the language, while developing new skills and... having fun!
