Our holiday workshops are an opportunity for children to take a break, have fun, discover and explore new things, while learning and practising English. Our activities are all focused on developing creativity and fostering speaking skills. Our objectives are to help children develop or maintain a taste for speaking English, develop confidence in their ability to speak and understand the language, while developing new skills and... having fun!

The dates of the upcoming holiday workshops are as follows:

_Back to School Fun Week_, from August, 26th to August, 30th 2019

_Fall Fun Weeks_, from October, 21st to October, 25th and from October, 28th to October, 31st 2019

Our holiday-workshops are open to children from 3 to 6 years of age in the morning, from 9am to midday, and for children aged from 6 to 14 in the afternoon, from 2pm to 5pm.
