  A dedicated holiday programme full of fun and creative things to do for
  children, while practising English.

Our holiday workshops are open to children from 3 onwards. They really are an opportunity for children to take a break, have fun, discover and explore new things, while learning and practising English. 

Our activities are all focused on fostering creativity and aimed at developing speaking skills. Our objectives are to help children develop or maintain a taste for speaking English, develop confidence in their ability to speak and understand a foreign language, while developing new skills and... having fun!

The next holiday workshop takes place **from Monday, 22nd to Friday, 26th October**. Families can choose between the morning slot (from 9am to 12pm,) and the afternoon one (from 2pm to 5pm). In total, that's 15 hours of activities in English for one whole week. The workshop costs 189 euros.
