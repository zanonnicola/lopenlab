The next holiday workshop takes place **from Wednesday, 2nd to Friday, 4th January**. It is open to children from 3 onwards and takes place either in the morning (from 9am to 12pm) or in the afternoon (from 2 to 5pm).  

Our holiday workshops are an opportunity for children to take a break, have fun, discover and explore new things, while learning and practising English. Our activities are all focused on developing creativity and fostering speaking skills. Our objectives are to help children develop or maintain a taste for speaking English, develop confidence in their ability to speak and understand the language, while developing new skills and... having fun!
