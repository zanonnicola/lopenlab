We have a dedicated holiday programme full of fun and creative things to do for kids to spend their break, while becoming more familiar with English. 

The programme for the next autumn school holiday will be available shortly. 

Leave us your contact details and a short message telling us a little more about what you’re after, we’d be happy to get in touch with you as soon as possible.
