    <p>After studying business and communications in Dublin and graphic design in Paris, I spent some years working in design studios and the publishing industry before taking the leap and setting up my own business as a freelance designer and artist. It was the beginning of an amazing adventure spanning 25 years where I have been involved in varied interesting projects in France and Ireland, creating images, objects, books and communication tools for cultural and child-care structures, government, hospitals, to name but a few.</p><p>And because I have always lived and worked in a bilingual context and understand how vital it is today to speak English, I now give design and illustration workshops through English at the Université de Nantes, l’Ecole de Design de Nantes and l’Université Catholique de l’Ouest.</p><p>For me, each project is a new challenge, a new story to tell and it has been exciting working with Cecilia creating L’Open LAB design together. When I am not designing, I am in my workshop painting and making sculptures in my studio in Trentemoult near Nantes and I have had the pleasure of exhibiting my work all over France and in Ireland.</p>
