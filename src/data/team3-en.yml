  description: |
    <p>I am an artist and an experienced art teacher, passionate about creation in every shape and form. Trilingual, I was born in Brazil, studied in the United States and fell in love with France, where I’ve been living for quite a few years now.</p><p>I have worked with children for more than 10 years, teaching fine arts, technology and S.T.E.M (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in both English and French. Having studied design and new media, I think I can safely say that I have more than one string to my bow. As well as mastering painting, watercolour, drawing, engraving and photography, I can create any kind of image or object, I love helping children familiarise themselves with new technologies and helping them better understand their environment through discovering S.T.E.M.</p><p>I have 2 young boys whom I have chosen to educate in a bilingual environment. Therefore, teaching languages to kids from their earliest age is something that I both believe in and can relate to. I enjoy collaborating, sharing and the possibility of creating together. I have worked closely with Cecilia on L’Open LAB for Kids’ curriculum, with particular focus on the Arts & Crafts workshops which I will deliver along with the workshops for children from 6 years of age onwards.</p>
