  description: |
    <p>Linguist, perfectly bilingual and a young Mum trained in active pedagogy learning, I love languages. I lived several years abroad, mainly in London and Shanghai. In 2015, I gave birth to my daughter and decided to speak only English to her. I began witnessing and learning about bilingualism in my daughter amongst other young children and I was amazed by their ability to learn English naturally and to switch from one language to another.</p><p>I decided to convey my passion for education and kids to be able to share the richness of learning a second language from the youngest age and so Lâ€™Open LAB for Kids was born.</p><p>I host the play in English workshops for toddlers and some of the afterschool workshops.</p>
